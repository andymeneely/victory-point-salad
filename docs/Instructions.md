Objective
=========
The goal of this game is to win the most victory points. This is achieved by collecting Resources and playing Specials.

Initial Setup
=============

Split the deck into separate piles by their backs.

Engines: separate each Engine by type and place in an open pile.
Resources: Shuffle the pile and place face down. Draw 1.5 cards per player, rounded down (e.g. 2-player game place 3 cards, 3-player place 4 cards) - place them face-up in a row next to the pile.
Blockers: Give each person one blocker card (i.e. The Artificial Need) and place face-up in their tableau.
Early Game: Shuffle the pile and place face-down. Draw 1.5 cards per player, rounded down (e.g. 2-player game place 3 cards, 3-player place 4 cards) - place them face-up in a row next to the pile.
Midgame: Shuffle the pile and place face-down under the Early Game cards.
Pay Up: Place under the Midgame cards
Endgame: Place under the Pay Up card.

Give every player:
  * An Artificial Need card on their tableau
  * 3 Resource cards on their tableau
  * 3 Early Game cards in their hand

The Cards
=========

Cards can have the following:
  * Resource. These are in the black strip along the left-hand side (e.g. Wood).
  * Trash: To play this card from your hand, you must trash the noted Resource from your Tableau. (This can be a card marked Resource or any other card)
  * Lock: To play this card, you must have at least one Resource on your tableau (e.g. Building, Military)
  * Description: This can have special rules about the card.
  * Victory Points: This is how much the card is worth at the end of the game, if it's in your Tableau

The Table
=========

Each player will have a Hand of cards (limited to 5 cards by the end of your turn).

Players also have a Tableau of cards that have been played in front of them. Some of these cards are simply victory points, other may have bonuses. The cards should be face-up, but can be arranged however the player wants (opponents may ask for cards on the Tableau to be shown). There are no restrictions on the number of cards you can have on your Tableau.

Special Purchase Pile: this is a rotating group of cards that you place into your Hand. Cards will cycle through quickly.
Resource Purchase Pile: this is a rotating group of cards that you place directly into their Tableau. Cards will cycle through quickly.
Engine Purchase Pile: these cards are always available to place in your hand.

Gameplay
========

On your turn, you get three *actions*. A given action can be one of the following:

* Take a Resource card and place directly in your Tableau
* Take a Special and place in your Hand (e.g. from the Purchase Pile or from the Engine pile)
* Play a Special card, trashing the necessary Resources with any substitutions. Place the card on your tableau.
* If your Hand contains more than 5 cards, you must trash your Hand down to 5 before the end of your turn

_The Chain Rule_ There is a special case where you may play multiple Specials for one action. If, upon playing a Special card, you have leftover Resources on the Resource Cards involved, you may play another special. This can continue as long as you have leftover resources on the cards.

For example: Suppose you have three Resource Cards: Wood+Clay, Stone, and Sheep. You play Special that requires a Clay, but now there's 1 Wood leftover. So you play a second Special that requires Wood and Stone, using up your Stone card. With no more leftover Resources, no other cards can be played (i.e. the Sheep must be part of a separate transaction).

Substitutions. In Victory Point Salad, the real bonuses are being able to exchange one resource when trashing another. These substitutions can be limited per-turn, or unlimited.

At the end of your turn, replenish the piles with new cards. Replenish from the right of the row, and remove the left-most card. If no card were obtained during that turn, remove two of the left-most cards.
