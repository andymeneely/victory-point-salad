Objective
=========
The goal of this game is to win the most victory points. This is achieved by collecting Resources and playing Specials.

Initial Setup
=============

On your turn, you get three *actions*. A given action can be one of the following:

* Take a Resource card and place directly in your Tableau
* Take a Special and place in your Hand
* Play a Special card, trashing the necessary Resources with any substitutions. Place the card on your tableau.

_The Chain Rule_ There is a special case where you may play multiple Specials for one action. If, upon playing a Special card, you have leftover Resources on the Resource Cards involved, you may play another special. This can continue as long as you have leftover resources on the cards.

For example: Suppose you have three Resource Cards: Wood+Clay, Stone, and Sheep. You play Special that requires a Clay, but now there's 1 Wood leftover. So you play a second Special that requires Wood and Stone, using up your Stone card. With no more leftover Resources, no other cards can be played (i.e. the Sheep must be part of a separate transaction).
