Do you play so many games with victory points that you call them "veeps"? Are you constantly shuffling around wood, stone, clay, gold, sheep, food, brick, pigs, vegetables, glass, silk, papyrus, grain, and cattle? If not, then you should try those games - they're really quite good.

If you have played those games, then Victory Point Salad will be a breath of fresh air. No more obfuscating the game mechanics behind a thin metaphor of farming/trading/settling/building. No fancy artwork tangentially related to the game. Just victory points.

And stuff.
Stuff that lets you get more stuff.
Stuff that lets you convert some stuff to other stuff.
And, of course, stuff that lets you turn your stuff into Victory Points.

All of this is packed into a small box of cards.
You won't need a custom foamcore tray to house an army of meeples.
You won't spend 25 minutes of your precious game night explaining arcane rules.
You won't be carrying around a box that outweighs a newborn child.

WARNING! This game will force you to make difficult decisions about what to keep and what to discard. Don't stress over it. It is still a game.
WARNING! This game favors those who have played it before. Don't expect to win if you haven't memorized the endgame cards.
WARNING! This game looks like a game of solitaire, until you realize that player interaction comes from denying your opponent from what they need. It also means we do have a pretty sweet solo campaign mode too.
